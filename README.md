View live on GitHub pages: https://mwmuni.github.io/topological_dynamics_visualisation/

## Overview

This project focuses on visualizing the neurotopology in reinforcement learning agents. The visualization provides insights into the network structure and dynamics as the agents learn and adapt. 

## Features

- Interactive visualization of neural network topology.
- Adjustable parameters for activation and difference thresholds.
- Phase navigation to observe different learning stages.
- Real-time updates on network connections and virtual connections.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mwmuni/topological_dynamics_visualisation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd topological_dynamics_visualisation
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- **Randomize Network:** Click the "Randomize Network" button to generate a new network topology.
- **Adjust Thresholds:** Use the sliders to set the activation and difference thresholds.
- **Phase Selection:** Select a phase using the radio buttons to observe different stages of learning.
- **Network Details:** View the total, filtered, and virtual connections in the counters.
